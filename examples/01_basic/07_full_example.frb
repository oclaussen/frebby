# This is the example featured in the README.md

# Basic types (strings, numbers, lists, hashes) can be used just like
# in Ruby:

some_number 5

some_string <<~TEXT
  This is
  a very long
  text
TEXT

# Nested objects are created like this:

some_object 'some_nested_object' do
  some_key 'some value'
  some_other_key 'some other value'
end

# Lists of objects are created by repeated blocks:

some_list do
  some_key 'some value'
end

some_list do
  some_other_key 'some other value'
end
