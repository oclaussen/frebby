# Sometimes you want to use a different name for a certain key in, for example
# if it contains characters that are not allowed in ruby method names. You can
# use the `transform` function for this:

require 'frebby/transform'

Frebby.transform 'id', into: '#id'

id 5

# Another frequent use case is that a specific key should always be rendered as
# an array, even if it is only used once. We included a `pluralize` function for
# this:

Frebby.pluralize 'hello', as: 'hellos'

hello 'world'
