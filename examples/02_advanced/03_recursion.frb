# The recursion module contains methods to include additional Frebby config
# files. These functions always run 'sandboxed' and have no acces to your
# current state.
# Files are referenced relative to the current file, as long as Frebby has any
# information what file it is currently reading. If you pass the configuration
# to Frebby from stdin, it will try to find these files relative to the current
# working directory instead.

require 'frebby/recursion'

# We use an absolute path so it always works
foo Frebby.read_file("#{Dir.pwd}/examples/02_advanced/01_transform.frb")

sample_text = <<~TEXT
  require 'frebby/transform'
  Frebby.pluralize 'bar', as: 'bars'

  bar 1
  baz 2
TEXT

foo Frebby.read_text(sample_text)

# These should not be affected by the pluralize in the nested calls
hello 'world'
bar 3
