# rubocop:disable Style/RescueStandardError

# The normal assignmet to a key is a ruby method call on a ruby object.
# This will fail if the method already exists on the object by default.

begin
  # In this case, you will get a weird error message, for example because the
  # method expects a different type or number ouf parameters, or it is private.
  # Or nothing happens at all, depending on the method:

  is_a? 'foo'
  send 'foo'
  test 'foo'
rescue
  # You can work around this by using the normal hash accessor to set the value
  # This is ugly, but better than nothing:

  self['is_a?'] = 'foo'
  self['send'] = 'foo'
  self['test'] = 'foo'
end
