# If you define custom functions in your config file, they will not be
# available in nested objects, because they are evaluated in a different scope.

# This will not work:

def my_value
  'something'
end

wont_work do
  value my_value
end

# Instead, you could define the methods as singletons on the top-level
# `Frebby` class, then they will be available throughout the rest of the config:

class ::Frebby
  def my_value
    'something'
  end
end

will_work do
  value my_value
end
