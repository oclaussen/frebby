# A frebby configuration always results in a JSON object. There is no
# obvious way to generate a JSON list on the top level. Some tools (for example
# Ansible playbooks) expect a JSON list though.

# You can work around this by inventing a new top-level key, and stripping
# this key afterwards with the `customize_result` hook:

require 'frebby/hooks'
Frebby.customize_result { |result| result['dummy'] }

dummy do
  foo 'bar'
end

dummy do
  hello 'world'
end
